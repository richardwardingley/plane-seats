Seats:  ABC  DEFG  HIJ

left = ['A','B','C'],
middle = ['D','E','F','G'],
right = ['H','I','J'],

left and right: if any seats booked, options = 0, else options = 1

middle: if E or F booked, options = 0
        if any 2 seats booked, options = 0
        if only D or G booked, options = 1
        if no seats booked, options = 2

2 functions:
    1. split bookings into rows
    2. check how many options on that row

if there is an empty row between given bookings, need to give full options - use rows num and range of seat bookings?
- get range from given rows
-

Tests:
- rename to explain more of their general purpose
- group tests by function
